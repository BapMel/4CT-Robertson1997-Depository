<p><a name="History"><strong>History.</strong></a></p><p>

The Four Color Problem dates back to 1852 when Francis Guthrie,
while trying to color the map of counties of England noticed that
four colors sufficed. He asked his brother Frederick if it was true
that <strong>any</strong> map can be colored using four colors in such
a way that adjacent regions (i.e. those sharing a common boundary
segment, not just a point) receive different colors. Frederick Guthrie then
communicated the  conjecture to DeMorgan. The first printed reference 
is due to Cayley in 1878.
</p><p>
A year later the first `proof' by Kempe appeared; its incorrectness was
pointed out by Heawood 11 years later. Another failed proof is due to
Tait in 1880; a gap in the argument was pointed out by Petersen in 1891.
Both failed proofs did have some value, though. Kempe discovered what
became known as Kempe chains, and Tait found an equivalent formulation
of the Four Color Theorem in terms of 3-edge-coloring.
</p><p>	
The next major contribution came from Birkhoff
whose work  allowed 
Franklin in 1922 to prove that the four color conjecture
is true for maps with at most 25 regions. It was also used
by other mathematicians  to make various forms
of progress on the four color problem. We should specifically mention
Heesch who developed the two main ingredients needed for the ultimate
proof - reducibility and discharging. While the concept of reducibility
was studied by other researchers as well, it appears that the idea
of discharging, crucial for the unavoidability part of the proof,
is due to Heesch, and that it was he who conjectured that a suitable
development of this method would solve the Four Color Problem.
</p><p>
This was confirmed by Appel and Haken in 1976, when they published
their proof of the Four Color Theorem 
<a href="#References"> [1,2]</a>.


</p><p><a name="Why"><strong>Why a new proof?</strong></a></p><p>

There are two reasons why the Appel-Haken proof is not completely
satisfactory.
</p><ul>
<li>Part of the Appel-Haken proof uses a computer, and cannot be
verified by hand, and
</li><li>even the part that is supposedly hand-checkable is extraordinarily 
complicated and tedious, and as far as we know, no one has verified it 
in its entirety.
</li></ul>
We have in fact tried to verify the Appel-Haken proof, but soon gave up.
Checking the computer part would not only require a lot of programming, 
but also inputing the descriptions of 1476 graphs, and that was not even the 
most controversial part of the proof.
<p>
We decided that it would be more profitable to work out our own proof.
So we did and came up with a proof and an algorithm that are described below.

</p><p><a name="Outline"><strong>Outline of the proof.</strong></a></p><p>

The basic idea of the proof is the same as Appel and Haken's. We exhibit
a set of 633 "configurations", and prove each of them is "reducible".
This is a technical concept that implies that no configuration with this
property can  appear in a minimal counterexample to the Four Color
Theorem. It can also be used in an algorithm, for if a reducible configuration
appears in a planar graph G, then one can construct in constant time
a smaller planar graph G' such that any four-coloring of G' can be converted
to a four-coloring of G in linear time.
</p><p>
It has been known since 1913 that every minimal counterexample to the
Four Color Theorem is an internally 6-connected triangulation. In the
second part of the proof we prove that at least one of our 633 configurations
appears in every internally 6-connected planar
triangulation (not necessarily a minimal counterexample to the 4CT).
This is called proving unavoidability, and uses the "discharging method",
first suggested by Heesch. Here our method differs from that 
of Appel and Haken.

</p><p><a name="Main"><strong>Main features of our proof.</strong></a></p><p>

We confirm a conjecture of Heesch that in proving unavoidability, a reducible
configuration can be found in the second neighborhood of an "overcharged"
vertex; this is how we avoid "immersion" problems that were a major
source of complication for Appel and Haken. Our unavoidable set has
size 633 as opposed to the 1476 member set of Appel and Haken, and our
discharging method uses only 32 discharging rules, instead of the 300+
of Appel and Haken. Finally, we obtain a quadratic algorithm to four-color
planar graphs (described later), an improvement over the quartic algorithm
of Appel and Haken.

</p><p><a name="Configurations"><strong>Configurations.</strong></a></p><p>

A <strong>near-triangulation</strong> is a
non-null connected loopless plane graph such that every finite
region is a triangle.
A <strong>configuration</strong> K consists of a near-triangulation G and a
map g from V(G) to the integers with the following properties:
</p><ol>
<li>for every vertex v, G\v has at most two
components, and if there are two, then the degree of v is g(v)-2,
</li><li>for every vertex v, if v is not incident with the infinite
region, then g(v) equals the degree of v, and otherwise g(v) is
greater than the degree of v; and
in either case g(v)&gt; 4,
</li><li>K has ring-size at least 2, where the <strong>ring-size</strong> of K
is defined to be the sum of g(v)-deg(v)-1, summed over all
vertices v incident with the infinite region such that G\v is connected.
</li></ol>
 
<p> 
When drawing pictures of configurations
we use a convention introduced by Heesch. The shapes
of vertices indicate the value of g(v) as follows:
A solid black circle means g(v)=5, a dot (or what appears
in the picture as no symbol at all) means g(v)=6, a hollow
circle means g(v)=7, a hollow square means
g(v)=8, a triangle means g(v)=9, and a pentagon
means g(v)=10. (We do not need vertices v with g(v)&gt; 11,
and only one vertex with g(v)=11, for which we do not use any
special symbol.) In the picture below 17 of our 633 reducible configurations
are displayed using the indicated convention. The whole set can be viewed
by clicking 
<a href="http://people.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/OLDFTP/fcdir/unavoidable.pdf">
here</a>. (We refer to (3.2) of our paper 
<a href="#References">[7]</a> for the meaning
of "thick edges" and "half-edges" in those pictures.)
</p><hr><img src="The%20Four%20Color%20Theorem_fichiers/confs.gif"><hr>

 
Any configuration isomorphic to one of the
<a href="http://people.math.gatech.edu/~thomas/OLDFTP/fcdir/unavoidable.pdf">
633 configurations </a> exhibited in
<a href="#References">[7]</a> is called a <strong>good</strong> configuration.
Let T be a triangulation.  A configuration K=(G,g) <strong>appears</strong> 
in T if
G is an induced subgraph of T, every finite region of
G is a region of T, and g(v) equals the degree of v in T for every vertex
v of G.  We prove the following two statements.
<p>
<strong>THEOREM 1.</strong>  If T is a minimal counterexample to the
Four Color Theorem, then no good configuration
appears in T.
</p><p>
<strong>THEOREM 2.</strong> For every internally 6-connected triangulation T, some
good configuration appears in T.
</p><p>
 
 From the above two theorems it follows that no minimal counterexample exists,
and so the 4CT is true. The first proof needs a computer.  The second can
be checked by hand in a few months, or, using a computer, it can be verified
in about 20 minutes.

</p><p><a name="Rules"><strong>Discharging rules.</strong></a></p><p>

Let T be an internally 6-connected triangulation.
Initially, every vertex v is assigned a charge of 10(6-deg(v)). It follows
from Euler's formula that the sum of the charges of all vertices is 120;
in particular, it is positive. We now redistribute the charges according
to the following rules, as follows. Whenever  T has a subgraph
isomorphic to one of the graphs in the figure below satisfying the degree
specifications (for a vertex v of a rule with a minus sign next to v this means
that the degree of the corresponding vertex of T is at most the value
specified by the shape of v, and analogously for vertices with a plus
sign next to them; equality is required for vertices with no sign next
to them) a charge of one (two in case of the first rule) is to be sent
along the edge marked with an arrow. 

<a name="PicRules"></a></p><hr><a name="PicRules"><img src="The%20Four%20Color%20Theorem_fichiers/rules.gif"><hr></a>

This procedure defines a new set
of charges with the same total sum. Since the total sum is positive,
there is a vertex v in T whose new charge is positive. We show that
a good configuration appears in the second neighborhood of v.
<p>
If the degree of v is at most 6 or at least 12, then this can be seen
fairly easily by a direct argument. For the remaining cases, however,
the proofs are much more complicated. Therefore, we have written the
proofs in a formal language so that they can be verified by a computer. 
Each individual step of these proofs is 
human-verifiable, but the proofs themselves are not really checkable
by hand, because of their length.


</p><p><a name="Pointers"><strong>Pointers.</strong></a></p><p>


The theoretical part of our proof is described in

The computer data and programs used to be located on an anonymous
ftp server, but that server has been phased out. The same files are
now available from

</p><p><a name="Algorithm"><strong>A quadratic algorithm.</strong></a></p><p>

The input to the algorithm will be a plane triangulation G with n vertices.
(This is without loss of generality, as any planar graph can be triangulated
in linear time.)
The output will be a coloring of the vertices of G with four colors.
</p><p>
If G has at most four vertices color each vertex a different color.
Otherwise if G has a vertex x of degree k &lt; 5, then the circuit C surrounding it is a `k-ring'.
Go to the k-ring analysis below.
Otherwise G has minimum degree five.
For every vertex we compute its charge as explained above, and find
a vertex v of positive charge. It follows from our proof of Theorem 2 that
either a good configuration appears in the second neighborhood of v
(it which case it can be found in linear time), or a k-ring violating
the definition of internal 6-connection can be found in linear time.
In the latter case we go to the k-ring analysis below, in the former case
we apply recursion to a certain smaller graph. A four-coloring of G can then
be constructed from the four-coloring of this smaller graph in linear time.
</p><p>
Given a k-ring R violating the definition of internal 6-connection
 a procedure developed by Birkhoff can be used. We apply recursion
to two carefully selected subgraphs of G. A four-coloring of G can 
then be constructed from the four-colorings of the two smaller graphs in
linear time.


</p><p><a name="Discussion"><strong>Discussion.</strong></a></p><p>

We should mention  that both our programs use only integer
arithmetic, and so we need not be concerned with round-off errors
and similar dangers of floating point arithmetic.
However, an argument can be made that our `proof' is not a proof in
the traditional sense, because it contains steps that can never be
verified by humans. In particular, we have not proved the
correctness of the compiler
we compiled our programs on, nor have we proved the infallibility of the
hardware we ran our programs on. These
have to be taken on faith, and are conceivably a source of error.
However, from a practical point of view,
the chance of a computer error that appears consistently
in exactly the same way on all runs of our programs on all the compilers
under all the operating systems that  our programs run on is
infinitesimally small compared to the chance of a human
error during the same amount of case-checking. Apart from
this hypothetical possibility of a computer consistently giving
an incorrect answer, the rest of our proof can be verified in the
same way as traditional mathematical proofs. We concede, however, that
verifying a computer program is much more difficult than checking
a mathematical proof of the same length.
